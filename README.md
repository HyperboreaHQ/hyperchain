# Hyperchain

Hyperchain is an essential component of the hyperbloom application.

Hyperchain provides mechanisms for creating a custom
proof of authority (private) blockchains on the hyperborea protocol.

These blockchains are autonomous and are directly controlled by one
single authority - their owner, which is responsible for creating
new blocks and digitally signing them. Information that needs to be
validated and indexed in the blockchain is shared in a distributed
clients network.
